**📝Impressions**
几个公式比较简单直接的触及了事务本质并且显得有一点特别：
LIFE FORMULAS I (2008)
These are notes to myself. Your frame of reference, and 
therefore your calculations, may vary. These are not definitions—these are algorithms for success. Contributions are welcome.

→ Happiness = Health + Wealth + Good Relationships
→ Health = Exercise + Diet + Sleep
→ Exercise = High Intensity Resistance Training + Sports + 
Rest
→ Diet = Natural Foods + Intermittent Fasting + Plants
→ Sleep = No alarms + 8–9 hours + Circadian rhythms
→ Wealth = Income + Wealth * (Return on Investment)
→ Income = Accountability + Leverage + Specific Knowledge
→ Accountability = Personal Branding + Personal Platform 
+ Taking Risk?
→ Leverage = Capital + People + Intellectual Property
→ Specific Knowledge = Knowing how to do something society 
cannot yet easily train other people to do
→ Return on Investment = “Buy-and-Hold” + Valuation + 
Margin of Safety

**💥My top 3 quotes**

书的确是人类的好朋友，因为过去几千年最优秀的思想家都是以书为媒，与你分享他
们的超凡智慧的。

大胆地为自己设定一个很高的时薪，并坚持执行。一个理想的时薪应该高到近乎离谱的程度，如果不是这样，那就还不够高。

随着年龄和阅历的增长，我逐渐发现，只要有足够的耐心，优秀的人就会成就一番大事业（至少在硅谷的科技行业是这样的）。20年前，我的职业生涯刚刚开启。当时我遇到一些出类拔萃的年轻人，我被他们的聪明才智和敬业精神深深折服。这些人无一例外都在随后的发展中获得了巨大的成功。大凡优秀之人，假以时日，都会大放异彩。这个时间期限可能比你想象的要长，也可能与他们自己的预期不符，但是，是金子总会发光。

对自己热爱的事物孜孜不倦，乐此不疲，不断精进，日积月累。不要去计算自己投入的时间和精力，因为一旦开始计算，你就会失去耐心。


如果你现在选择一条容易的路，那么你的未来会变得更加艰难。
